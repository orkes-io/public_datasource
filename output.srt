1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:27,863
Just 50 years ago, we finally ventured to the moon.

2
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:52,903
For the very first time, we looked back at our own planet.

3
00:00:52,903 --> 00:01:03,583
Since then, the human population has more than doubled.

4
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:11,783
This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain and reveal what we must preserve

5
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:35,703
to ensure people and nature thrive.

6
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:43,623
When human beings built their first settlements some 10,000 years ago, the world around them,

7
00:01:43,623 --> 00:02:00,063
on the land and in the sea, was full of life.

8
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:13,743
For generations, this stable Eden nurtured our growing civilizations.

9
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:22,703
But now, in the space of just one human lifetime,

10
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:25,183
all that has changed.

11
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:32,063
In the last 50 years, wildlife populations have on average declined by 60%.

12
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:51,023
For the first time in human history, the stability of nature can no longer be taken for granted.

13
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,143
But the natural world is resilient.

14
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:02,143
Great riches still remain.

15
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:12,463
And with our help, the planet can recover.

16
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:26,463
Never has it been more important to understand how the natural world works and how to help it.

17
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:56,463
Wildlife still flourishes in astonishing numbers in the few precious places.

18
00:03:56,463 --> 00:04:08,463
Along the Peruvian coastline, the world continues to change.

19
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,463
On the Caribbean coast of South America,

20
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:15,503
seabirds congregate in colonies millions strong.

21
00:04:19,763 --> 00:04:21,963
They come here to breed.

22
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:35,283
Every morning, the birds leave their colonies

23
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:39,503
to fish in one of the richest seas on Earth.

24
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:55,683
It is an astonishing daily migration of five million birds.

25
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:03,563
The huge flocks of cormorants and boobies

26
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:05,803
are all seeking one thing...

27
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,263
anchovies.

28
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,263
Anchovies.

29
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:27,363
The boobies carpet-bomb the shoals.

30
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:32,363
More and more birds join the feeding frenzy.

31
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:15,903
["The Greatest Showdown of the Century"]

32
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:25,503
All in this immense assembly

33
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:30,663
are here because a powerful oceanic current, the Humboldt,

34
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,043
sweeps up from the Antarctic,

35
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:40,043
bringing with it rich nutrients from the ocean's depths.

36
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:46,043
Ninety percent of the life in the oceans

37
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:50,043
is found in the shallow seas close to the coast.

38
00:06:54,043 --> 00:07:00,043
Away from the land, the seas, for the most part, are a blue desert.

39
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:04,043
But even these distant waters may be enriched

40
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:08,043
by a most unexpected connection to the land.

41
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:18,043
Some deserts, often hundreds of kilometers from the ocean,

42
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:30,043
provide the raw materials for life.

43
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:39,043
Every year, winds sweep up two billion tons of dust into the sky.

44
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:46,043
At least a quarter of it eventually falls on the sea,

45
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:50,043
providing nutrients needed by the microscopic organisms

46
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:55,043
that are the foundations of ocean life.

47
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:08,043
Dolphins explore the vast open ocean

48
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:14,043
in search of the riches of the ocean.

49
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:17,043
that distant deserts may have nourished.

50
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:30,723
A shoal of mackerel has discovered a swarm of krill,

51
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:34,203
the small crustaceans

52
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:37,603
that feed on the ocean's floating microscopic plants.

53
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:42,963
But the mackerel themselves are food for the dolphins.

54
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:02,643
They drive the mackerel towards the surface

55
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:07,643
and into the range of birds,

56
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:08,923
shearwaters.

57
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,883
The wings that normally propel the birds through the air

58
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:17,323
now drive them six metres down through the water.

59
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,323
Once the birds pick off the top of the shoal,

60
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:30,323
the dolphins attack the underside.

61
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:01,083
The mackerel will run out of sugar anday

62
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:12,283
After 20 minutes of feasting,

63
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,603
the predators from both the sea

64
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:17,843
and the ocean have dug a trench to shelter themselves.

65
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:21,143
The sea and the air have had their fill.

66
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:44,083
The stability of life on our planet relies on such connections

67
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,423
between different habitats.

68
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:52,723
Water evaporating from the surface of the sea

69
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:56,103
condenses to form great clouds.

70
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:04,603
And these eventually release the fresh water as rain.

71
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:11,563
But these life-giving rains are not evenly spread over the land.

72
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:21,703
This vast salt pan in Africa

73
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:25,463
is all that remains of an ancient lake.

74
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:31,343
It's totally waterless and oven-hot.

75
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:35,263
Few places on the land are more hostile to life.

76
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:43,683
A few tracks cross it,

77
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:48,143
made by animals searching unsuccessfully for water.

78
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:53,143
But whoce land are they?

79
00:11:53,143 --> 00:12:17,443
But very occasionally, this whole landscape

80
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:22,283
is transformed.

81
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:44,283
A huge deluge drenches the salt path.

82
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:55,283
The Algae

83
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:03,283
Triggered by some unknown signal,

84
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:09,283
flocks of lesser flamingos arrive from thousands of kilometers away.

85
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,283
The Algae

86
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,883
The algae that the flamingos feed on

87
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:26,883
have lain dormant as spores in the dust.

88
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:35,883
But most importantly, the birds are here to breed.

89
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:42,883
Perfect conditions might occur only once in a decade.

90
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:52,883
The birds nest on an island far from the shore.

91
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:57,883
They build mounds of mud that raise up their eggs

92
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:05,883
and so keep them just marginally cooler than they would be at ground level.

93
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,483
The water surrounding the island is so salty

94
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,483
that predators do not venture into it.

95
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:29,483
So the nests are safe.

96
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:34,603
Thirty days later, thousands of chicks start to hatch.

97
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:52,003
But there is no shelter from the scorching sun.

98
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:58,963
The water that once surrounded their island protecting them

99
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,763
has now dried up altogether.

100
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:13,283
The last to hatch step out into a desperately harsh world.

101
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:16,823
The last to hatch step out into a desperately harsh world.

102
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:32,003
Somehow or other, the flowing chicks must find fresh water to drink.

103
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:39,003
They cannot yet fly, so they must walk, guided by some of the adults.

104
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:45,003
They may have to trek for 50 kilometers.

105
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:13,623
Now they have a place to don their littleumu.

106
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:35,843
Some cannot keep up.

107
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:57,843
The salt has solidified around their legs.

108
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:27,723
Most of the chicks, in spite of everything, and having walked for days, eventually reach

109
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:37,123
fresh water.

110
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:56,883
It is the end of a long journey, but only the first of the trials that will be imposed

111
00:17:56,883 --> 00:18:11,403
on these flamingos by the irregularity of the rains.

112
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:18,943
If rainfall is more predictable and certain, then life can flourish more richly, both in

113
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:25,883
numbers and variety.

114
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:31,363
The Serengeti Plains in East Africa support over a million wildebeest.

115
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:39,663
The herds follow the seasonal rains,

116
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,543
grazing on the newly sprouting grass that comes in their wake.

117
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,303
Each year, within a three-week period,

118
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:02,183
the females give birth to over a quarter of a million calves.

119
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:14,063
This youngster is just a few days old.

120
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:26,623
Playing strengthens its legs for the long journey that lies ahead.

121
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,683
Meow.

122
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,683
The calf must stay close to its mother.

123
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:56,523
Without her milk, it would starve.

124
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,163
And the herds are always traveling,

125
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:07,503
following the rains as they drift across the plains,

126
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:13,423
in order to find fresh grazing.

127
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:34,343
Eventually, they reach woodlands.

128
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:41,763
Hunting dogs.

129
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:49,763
Wildebeest calves are a favorite prey.

130
00:20:49,763 --> 00:21:08,763
And the dogs are hungry.

131
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:20,763
The calf must stay with its mother, protected within the herd.

132
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:58,763
The dogs have incredible stamina.

133
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:08,763
But the calf is defended by the herd.

134
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:34,763
They need the calf on its own.

135
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:38,763
The mother blocks the dogs.

136
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:41,203
shielding her calf,

137
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:50,803
it makes a run for safety,

138
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:57,803
and it just manages to get back to the herd.

139
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:27,803
The future of this whole migration depends on the regularity of the reins, but also on

140
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:45,763
the continued existence of the great open grasslands across which the herds make their

141
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:52,763
immense journeys. In places where rains fall abundantly throughout

142
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:05,003
the year, forests grow. And in the warmth of the tropics, they support

143
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:12,323
an unparalleled richness of life. Half of all the species of landliving animals

144
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:19,323
live in these stable worlds. The sheer diversity is breathtaking.

145
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:35,323
We still have not catalogued all the species that live in the tropical forests.

146
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:48,603
["The Magic Flute Tune"]

147
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:58,243
The relationships between them all are multitudinous and complex.

148
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:08,243
Plants often depend on animals to pollinate their flowers.

149
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:18,843
And these intimate connections are just as important as the great global ones.

150
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:25,843
["The Magic Flute Tune"]

151
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:34,483
These are traps, flowers shaped like buckets produced by an orchid.

152
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:41,483
["The Magic Flute Tune"]

153
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:48,723
Each red bucket is filled with an oily liquid that drips from above.

154
00:25:54,563 --> 00:26:00,363
Male orchid bees need a rich perfume with which to impress their females.

155
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:05,363
And the orchids provide it.

156
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:10,603
But the bucket is slippery.

157
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:17,603
And the liquid into which the bee has fallen is sticky.

158
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:26,123
The only way to get out is through a narrow tunnel.

159
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:29,123
["The Magic Flute Tune"]

160
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:33,203
As it emerges, the bee is gripped tight.

161
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:53,203
And that gives enough time for the plant to glue pollen sacks on the bee's back.

162
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:58,203
and the bee is rewarded with a perfume with which,

163
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:11,483
when it recovers its strength, it can woo a female.

164
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:16,483
There are no pronounced seasons in a rainforest.

165
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:30,323
It produces food in one form or another the year round.

166
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:37,703
It's so rich that the females of some birds

167
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:41,463
are able to raise their young entirely by themselves,

168
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:44,543
and that allows the males to spend their whole time

169
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:49,083
attracting females, as mannequins do.

170
00:27:51,423 --> 00:27:53,823
There are over 50 different species,

171
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:57,343
each with its own highly elaborate dance routine.

172
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:02,343
The golden-collared mannequin starts

173
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:09,663
by clearing his dance floor.

174
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:21,623
A female arrives and he starts his routine

175
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:26,623
of rocketing from one perch to another.

176
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:33,743
She checks out every detail.

177
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:45,543
Finally, he performs his signature move,

["The Red-Capped Mannequin"]

180
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:00,723
Perfection.

181
00:29:04,803 --> 00:29:08,683
The red-capped mannequin has a very different act.

182
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:14,403
It's a kind of sliver.

183
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:17,403
["The Red-Capped Mannequin"]

184
00:29:24,523 --> 00:29:26,323
With wing snaps.

["The Red-Capped Mannequin"]

186
00:29:38,983 --> 00:29:41,483
But she does seem to be working.

00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:57,483
["The Red-Capped Mannequin"]

188
00:29:58,523 --> 00:29:59,983
She's seen enough.

189
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:09,323
The most complex routine is that developed by the blue mannequin.

190
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:11,163
["The Red-Capped Mannequin"]

191
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:15,663
The lead male is supported by three junior dancers.

192
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:20,863
They practice together almost every day.

193
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:27,503
During rehearsals, a young male in juvenile plumage

194
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,243
stands in for the female.

00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:34,243
["The Red-Capped Mannequin"]

196
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:37,343
The dance has to be perfectly synchronized.

197
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:45,543
With the lead male happy,

["The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"]

201
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,083
The lead male performs the final move.

202
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,083
Have they done enough?

203
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,083
What's her decision?

204
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:54,083
It's a yes!

205
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:59,083
["The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"]

206
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,083
A great team effort.

207
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:11,083
Tropical forests cover only seven percent of the planet's lands.

208
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:17,083
Away from the tropics, where the weather is seasonal and cooler,

209
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,083
they're very different.

210
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,083
["The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"]

211
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:25,083
The greatest of all is the boreal forest

212
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:30,083
that extends right across North America and Eurasia.

213
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:40,083
It cannot grow during the frigid grip of winter.

214
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:45,083
["The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"]

215
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:48,083
The forests are a crucial refuge

216
00:32:48,083 --> 00:33:06,083
for the relatively few species that are able to survive here.

217
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:11,083
As winter approaches,

218
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:15,083
caribou grazing on the open tundra to the north

219
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:19,543
head south to the forest to seek food and shelter.

220
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:24,543
Out here, temperatures may fall below minus 40 degrees centigrade.

221
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:29,543
The forest will give some protection from the worst of the weather.

222
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:59,543
But now, the caribou are not traveling alone.

223
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:29,543
Wolves.

224
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:33,043
They live in the forest year-round.

225
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:51,043
And in the winter, they specialize in hunting caribou.

226
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:58,043
They must find the freshest tracks.

227
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:17,443
They move fast by avoiding the deep snow,

228
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:21,643
sticking to the hard-packed trails made by the caribou.

229
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:40,063
This wolf has found fresh scent.

230
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:52,223
The caribou must be close.

231
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:59,223
The herd chooses to stop to rest on a frozen lake.

232
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:06,563
Out in the open, they will be able to spot approaching danger.

233
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:24,403
And, sure enough, the wolves catch up.

234
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:42,403
They start to test the caribou, probing for any weakness.

235
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:54,103
Out on the open lake, the caribou can outrun the wolves.

236
00:36:54,103 --> 00:37:05,403
So the wolves drive them back into the forest.

237
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:21,403
Here in the deep snow, progress is much harder.

238
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:24,683
and slower.

239
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:38,123
And hidden by the trees, the wolves can get closer.

240
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:56,443
The hunt is on.

241
00:37:56,443 --> 00:38:11,323
The pack must decide which particular caribou to target and which trail to take.

242
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:21,643
As the caribou scatter, the leading wolf takes a wrong turn.

243
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:35,603
It's a crucial mistake, and the wolves abandon the chase.

244
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:41,323
With the coming of spring, the caribou will head north once more, leaving the wolves and

245
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:46,163
the forest behind.

246
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:52,363
They will travel 600 kilometers, crossing mountains to reach the tundra, where the spring

247
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:59,083
grass will be sprouting again, and they can give birth.

248
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:05,883
But these migrations are a shadow of what they once were.

249
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:14,963
The herd has lost nearly 70 percent of its numbers in the last 20 years.

250
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:19,563
Their world, and all of our planet, is now changing fast.

251
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:28,843
At the furthest polar extremes

252
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:37,183
lie the frozen wildernesses of Antarctica and the Arctic.

253
00:39:42,023 --> 00:39:45,863
Though they may seem remote to many of us,

254
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:48,323
the stability of these icy wastes

255
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:54,323
is crucial to all life on the planet.

256
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:59,703
But in just 70 years,

257
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:04,703
things have changed at a frightening pace.

258
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,343
The polar regions are warming faster

259
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:14,343
than any other part of the planet.

260
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:19,363
The Arctic in the north is a frozen ocean,

261
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:28,363
and the sea ice, on which all life here depends,

262
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:44,383
is disappearing.

263
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:49,383
Polar bears specialize in hunting seals

264
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:55,383
out on the frozen ocean.

265
00:40:55,383 --> 00:41:01,383
But that world is now literally melting beneath their feet.

266
00:41:05,383 --> 00:41:08,383
The sea ice breaks up every year,

267
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,383
but now this is happening earlier,

268
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:17,383
and the bears' limited hunting season is getting shorter.

269
00:41:17,383 --> 00:41:25,383
This is already having a profound impact.

270
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:38,243
Cubs are growing up underweight,

271
00:41:38,243 --> 00:41:56,243
which reduces their chances of survival.

272
00:41:56,243 --> 00:42:03,243
Within the lifetime of these cubs,

273
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:09,243
the Arctic in summer could be largely free of sea ice.

274
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:16,243
It's not just the sea ice that is vanishing.

275
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:23,243
The ice that lies on land is also changing fast.

276
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:30,243
It's not just the sea ice that is vanishing.

277
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:36,243
The ice that lies on land is also changing fast.

278
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:44,243
This is Greenland, a vast expanse of ice,

279
00:42:44,243 --> 00:42:54,243
one-fifth the size of the United States.

280
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:58,243
This glacial ice, together with the sea ice,

281
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:03,243
protects our planet by reflecting solar radiation away from the surface

282
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:09,243
and so preventing the Earth from overheating.

283
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:15,243
But the Arctic is warming dramatically.

284
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:33,243
The leading edge of the Storr glacier may appear to be frozen.

285
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:39,283
emotionless, but glaciers can move at up to 45 meters a day.

286
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:51,223
Where this one meets the sea, it towers 100 meters above the water

287
00:43:51,223 --> 00:44:02,223
and continues downward for another 400 meters beneath the surface.

288
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:46,223
Over the last 20 years, Greenland has been losing ice.

289
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:56,223
And the rate of loss is accelerating.

290
00:45:11,223 --> 00:45:15,223
These massive ice falls from the top of the glacier

291
00:45:15,223 --> 00:45:21,223
are just the beginnings of a far greater event.

292
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:28,223
A stretch of the front face of the glacier over a kilometer long

293
00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:46,223
is starting to break away.

294
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:48,223
The Ice is Surging Upwards

295
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:57,943
From 400 meters beneath the surface,

296
00:45:57,943 --> 00:46:16,943
the hidden ice is surging upwards.

297
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,943
The breakaway of an iceberg the size of a skyscraper

298
00:46:22,943 --> 00:46:26,943
generates a colossal tidal wave.

299
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:58,943
The Ice is Surging Upwards

300
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:28,943
The Ice is Surging Upwards

301
00:47:28,943 --> 00:47:41,943
The Ice is Surging Upwards

302
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:45,943
Within 20 minutes, 75...

303
00:47:48,663 --> 00:47:51,503
million tons of ice break free.

304
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:02,383
Glaciers have always released ice into the ocean,

305
00:48:03,683 --> 00:48:09,023
but now this is happening nearly twice as fast as it did ten years ago.

306
00:48:12,283 --> 00:48:17,743
Around the world, ice is now feeding vast amounts of freshwater into the sea,

307
00:48:17,743 --> 00:48:24,203
raising sea levels, changing salinity, and disrupting ocean currents.

308
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:32,963
Without the Humboldt Current, the coast of Peru would fall silent.

309
00:48:32,963 --> 00:48:45,383
The seabird spectacle would be no more.

310
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:54,023
All across our planet, crucial connections are being disrupted.

311
00:48:54,023 --> 00:49:03,203
The stability that we and all life relies upon is being lost.

312
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:09,703
What we do in the next 20 years

313
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:24,083
will determine the future for all life on Earth.

314
00:49:24,163 --> 00:49:29,143
The rest of this series will explore the planet's most important habitats

315
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:41,063
and celebrate the life they still support.

316
00:49:41,143 --> 00:49:45,063
We will reveal what must be preserved

317
00:49:45,063 --> 00:50:02,063
if we are to ensure a future where humans are safe.

318
00:50:02,063 --> 00:50:07,063
